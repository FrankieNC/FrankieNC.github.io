Welcome to my website! I graduated with First Class Honours in Mathematics from King's College London and am currently pursuing a Master's in Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London. My research interests are focused on geometric and combinatorial group theory, and I am aspiring to continue my studies with a PhD in this field.
