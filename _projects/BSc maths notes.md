### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note Before You Dive In

These notes are very much a work-in-progress ‚Äî and in many ways, a time capsule.

- The **Year 1 notes** were my first attempt at using LaTeX, so they're full of **typos**, formatting quirks, and clunky notation. Be kind.
- Some notes are **incomplete** ‚Äî either because I was too lazy, too busy, or because life (and deadlines) got in the way.
- Course content may have changed since I took these modules. These notes reflect what I was taught at the time, and may not perfectly match current syllabi.

Despite all that, I hope you find something useful here. Use them, improve them, ignore them ‚Äî your choice.

### üìö Looking for Better Notes?

If you're after more polished, complete, and overall better notes, I highly recommend checking out the work of my dearest comrade and brother, Jan Olucha Fuentes:

üëâ **[Visit his site here](https://janolucha.github.io)**  
*https://janolucha.github.io*

His notes are cleaner, better organised, and written with more care and (a lot of) caffeine-induced shenanigans than mine. A true act of service to the maths student community.
